  Uploads and releases apps to Google Play Store.

  The step supports single APK, [multiple APK](https://developer.android.com/google/play/publishing/multiple-apks.html) and Bundle deploys.

  To use this step:

  1. Upload the first apk manually (using the web interface):
  
    Visit the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish) -> All applications -> CREATE APPLICATION

  2. Link your Google Play Developer Console to an API project:
  
    Described in [Google Play Developer API](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started)'s __Linking your API Project__ section

  3. Setup API Access Clients, using a service account:
  
    Described in [Google Play Developer API](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started)'s __Using a service account__ section

    __NOTE__: When you create your service account on the google developer console, choose json as `Key Type`.

  4. Grant the necessary rights to the service account:
  
    Visit the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish) -> Settings -> Users & permissions -> Invite new user.

    Due to the way the Google Play Publisher API works, you have to grant at least the following permissions to that service account:

      - ACCESS LEVEL: View app information
      - RELEASE MANAGEMENT: Manage production releases, Manage testing track releases
      - STORE PRESENCE: Edit store listing, pricing & distribution

  5. OPTIONAL - Add translations for your Store Listing:
  
    To allow the step to assign your 'whatsnew' files to the uploaded apk version.

      description: |-
        Path to the expansion file.

        Leave empty or provide exactly the same number of paths as in app_path, separated by `|` character and start each path with the expansion file's type
        separated by a `:`. (main, patch)

        Format examples:

        - `main:/path/to/my/app.obb`
        - `patch:/path/to/my/app1.obb|main:/path/to/my/app2.obb|main:/path/to/my/app3.obb`

        Can be one of the built-in tracks: internal, alpha, beta, rollout, production.
        
        Or you can set your custom track name as well. 
        
        For example: `pre-release`, or any of your closed track you added in Google Play Developer Console.

      title: User Fraction
      description: |-
        Portion of the users who should get the staged version of the app. Accepts values between 0.0 and 1.0 (exclusive-exclusive).

      is_required: false
  - whatsnews_dir:
    opts:
      title: "Directory of localized what's new files"
      description: |-
        Use this input to specify localized 'what's new' files directory.

        This directory should contain 'whatsnew' files postfixed with the locale.

        what's new file name pattern: `whatsnew-LOCALE`

        Example:
        
        ```
        + - [PATH/TO/WHATSNEW]
            |
            + - whatsnew-en-US
            |
            + - whatsnew-de-DE
        ```

        Format examples:

        - "./"         # what's new files are in the repo root directory
        - "./whatsnew" # what's new files are in the whatsnew directory
  - mapping_file: "$BITRISE_MAPPING_PATH"
    opts:
      title: Location of your mapping.txt file

  - untrack_blocking_versions: "true"
    opts:
      title: "Untrack blocking versions?"
      description: |-
        Should deactivate apps, with lower version code, on lower level tracks?

        E.g.: 
        If you have an __active apk on alpha__ track with version code: `42`.
        And you try to __upload a new version (`43`), to the beta track__, you will see an error:

        `Version 42 of this app can not be downloaded by any devices as they will all receive APKs with higher version codes`

        To avoid this issue set this input to: `"true"` and the step will deactivate every app with lower version code, on lower level tracks.
      value_options:
      - "true"
      - "false"
      is_required: true
  - apk_path:

        Path to the APK to deploy.

        You can provide multiple APK paths separated by `|` character.
