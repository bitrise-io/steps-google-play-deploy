  To use this step:

  1. You have to upload the first apk manually (using the web interface).
    See: https://play.google.com/apps/publish -> All applications -> Add new application

  2. You must link your Google Play Developer Console to an API project.
    See: https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started (Linking your API Project section)

  3. Setting Up API Access Clients, using a service account:
    See: https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started (Using a service account)
    When you create your service account on the google developer console choose json as Key Type.

  4. Grant Access to provide the service account the necessary rights.
    See: https://play.google.com/apps/publish -> Settings -> User account & rights -> Invite new user and give the privileges.
    Due to the way the Google Play Publisher API works, you have to grant at least the following permissions to that service account:
     - Edit store listing, pricing & distribution
     - Manage Production APKs
     - Manage Alpha & Beta APKs
     - Manage Alpha & Beta users
  
  5. OPTIONAL - Add translations for your Store Listing.
    To allow the step to assign your whats news to the uploaded apk version.

        Path to the Service Account's JSON key file.

        For remote JSON key file you can provide any download location (ex: `https://URL/TO/key.json`).
        For local JSON key file provide file path url. (ex: `file://PATH/TO/key.json`).

        You can provide multiple APK paths separated by `|` character.

  - whatsnews_dir:
    opts:
      title: "Directory of localised whatsnew files"
      description: |-
        Use this input to specify localised whatsnew files directory.

        This directory should contain whatsnew files postfixed with the locale.

        whatsnew file name pattern: `whatsnew-LOCALE`

        Example:
        
        ```
        + - [PATH/TO/WHATSNEWS]
            |
            + - whatsnew-en-US
            |
            + - whatsnew-de-DE
        ```

        Format examples:

        - "./"         # whatsnew files are in the repo root directory
        - "./whatsnew" # whatsnew files are in the whatsnew directory
  - untrack_blocking_versions: "true"
    opts:
      title: "Untrack blocking versions?"
      description: |-
        Should deactivate apks, with lower version code, on lower level tracks?

        E.g.: 
        If you have an __active apk on alpha__ track with version code: `42`.
        And you try to __upload a new version (`43`), to the beta track__, you will see error, like this:

        `Version 42 of this app can not be downloaded by any devices as they will all receive APKs with higher version codes`

        To avoid this issue set this input to: `"true"` and the step will deactivate every apk with lower version code, on lower level tracks.
